I developed functions that enable other engineers at JDES to use the calibrated values for the vision tests they develop. My contribution will reduce the number of engineering hours required to build manufacturing tests and reduce false failures when testing units.",

Grama features modeling and data manipulation tools to enable engineers to facilitate rapid model analysis, communication of results, and analysis of systems with uncertainty (e.g. in material properties such as strength and elasticity).<br><br>My contributions included:<ul><li>Re-architecture of error handling to improve maintainability of the code base.</li><li>Improving the quality of error messages to make Grama’s tools more accessible by modeling the Tidyverse error design considerations (concise descriptions and a hint to common issues, aka human readable!).</li><li>Increasing test coverage.</li><li>Expanding documentation for the existing code base, including more narrowly defining known issues to make contributing more accessible.</li><li>Instructing students in an engineering professional development program (using Grama) on how to use data science tools in their work.</li><li>Collaborating with a team of researchers to study how engineers approach variability and how to better educate engineers to account for material variability in their problem solving.</li></ul><br>Image of Grama models <a href='https://github.com/zdelrosario/evc-course/blob/main/exercises/e-grama01-basics-master.ipynb'>credited to Zach del Rosario</a>.",

I handled everything: project planning, running team meetings, scheduling, managing material lists, and managing a budget. In total, the project involved 21 separate racks which had Ethernet, single-mode fiber, 62.5µm multi-mode fiber, GPS signal, and IRIG clock signal connections.",

My primary responsibilities included delegating tasks, managing the project timeline, coaching the drive team, and educating junior members on the team on technical skills necessary to build robots. In total, I managed the building of three different robots to end up with the final design (pictured) - which went on to be undefeated in qualifications and ranked number one at the Iowa Regional out of 61 robots.<br><br>Post graduation, I have returned to the team as a technical mentor. I provide guidance and education for the electrical and programming portions of the robot. I also help with the “rapid prototyping” stages of the season, where I encourage students to test ideas quickly and use failure as an opportunity to iterate on their designs.<br><br>I believe it is important to give back through volunteer efforts. Robotics helped me realize my passion for Electrical & Computer Engineering, and I want to give students the same opportunities that were given to me.",
